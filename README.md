# Breast Cancer Prediction ‚Äî AI & ML Project

This project focuses on predicting breast cancer using Machine Learning techniques, specifically a Supervised Learning-Classification Algorithm. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify breast cancer cases based on input features.

## Features

- Breast cancer prediction using various supervised learning classification algorithms
- Website deployment on Heroku
- Utilization of HTML5, CSS3, JS, Django, and ML frameworks such as scikit-learn

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Django
- scikit-learn

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following components:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned, missing values are handled, and features are preprocessed to prepare the data for the machine learning algorithm.

2. **Machine Learning Model**: A supervised learning classification algorithm, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests, is implemented to train the model on the preprocessed dataset.

3. **Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics to assess its performance and accuracy in predicting breast cancer cases.

4. **Website Deployment**: The trained model is integrated into a web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The web application allows users to input relevant information and get predictions regarding breast cancer.

## Usage

To use this project:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/jayanth9676/AI-breast-cancer.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Preprocess the dataset and train the machine learning model.
4. Deploy the web application using the provided HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
5. Access the web application and input the required information to get breast cancer predictions.
